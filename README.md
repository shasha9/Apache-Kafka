# APACHE KAFKA
Apache Kafka is an open-source stream-processing software platform developed by LinkedIn and donated to the Apache Software Foundation, written in Scala and Java. The project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds.

There are four major APIs in Kafka:

Producer API – Permits an application to publish streams of records.

Consumer API – Permits an application to subscribe to topics and processes streams of records.

Connector API – Executes the reusable producer and consumer APIs that can link the topics to the existing applications.

Streams API – This API converts the input streams to output and produces the result.
